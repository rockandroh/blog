## 5.1 Introduction to factor markets

- The factor (i.e., resource) market is where the factors of production are sold by households to businesses. 
- The factors of production are land, labor, capital, and entrepreneurship.
- The corresponding payments for these factors of production are rent, wage, interest, and profit. 

**Derived Demand**
- the demand for resources is determined (derived) by the products they help to produce
- Take labor market as an example
  - What is Demand for Labor?
    - Demand is the different quantities of workers that business are **willing** and **able** to hire at different wages
    - When wage level increases, the quantity of inputs demanded decreases.
    - When wage level decreases, the quantity of inputs demanded increases.

Key terms

- Marginal product
  - The additional product that is produced by each additional input. We calculated this number by dividing the change in the total product by the change in the number of inputs.
- Marginal revenue product
  - The marginal revenue generated for a firm by each additional resource. 
- Marginal resource cost
  - The additional cost incurred by hiring or employing one more unit of the resource.

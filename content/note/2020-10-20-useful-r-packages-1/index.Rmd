## Misc

#### Make Calendar

```{r}
#install.packages('calendR')
library(calendR)
calendR(year = 2020, month=10, title.size = 10, 
        subtitle = "Have a nice day",
        subtitle.col = 'Blue',
        day.size = 3,
        weeknames.size = 4,
        weeknames.col = 'blue',
        weeknames = c('Mon','Tue','Wed','Thu','Fri','Sat','Sun'),
        start = 'M',
        special.days = 'weekend',
        special.col = 'skyblue',
        lty = 1, margin = 0
        )

```

#### Checkpoint

The goal of `checkpoint` is to solve the problem of package reproducibility in R. Specifically, `checkpoint` solve the problems that occur when you donâ€™t have the correct versions of R packages. Since packages get updated on CRAN all the time, it can be difficult to recreate an environment where all your packages are consistent with some earlier state.

Hello, this is Roh `$\rho$` ! 

Hello, my name is Hyunwoo Roh and you can call me Roh. After finishing the grad school in US and working as consultant/researcher in IT finance company, now I stay in a city called Daegu (Korea) doing civil service for two years. My research interests focus on statistical and machine learning analysis on data related to finance industry.

While studying in University of Chicago (UoC), I was a [teaching assistant](/teaching) and grader for several courses in statistics, econometrics, and finance courses at bachelor and master's level. I did screenshot my part of course evaluation done by the UoC students. See my CV to have a more detailed overview of my academic and professional background.

Given my experience, I also help academics and professionals in performing statistical data analyses for their academic or work related projects. Feel free to contact me if you need help for your statistical analyses.

I am another boring consultant & data scientist who interested in applying Stat/ML models in financial data.

I collected the materials including lecture notes, videos, books, and solution manuals that were extremely helpful to me!! I would like to thank every one of them who made lots of efforts to create such an invaluable learning supplements. I hope these lists will become a friendly companion for your study as well. And please understand that  I could not list up all useful materials that I have found due to my poor memory and lack of space :(

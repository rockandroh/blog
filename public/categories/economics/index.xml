      <description>This page is about the economics term “Price Elasticity”.
Setting the right price for your product or service is hard. In fact, determining price is one of the toughest things a marketer has to do, in large part because it has such a big impact on the company’s bottom line. One of the critical elements of pricing is understanding what economists call “price elasticity” - HBR
By definition, price elasticity of demand refers to the number calculated by the following formula \[ \epsilon=\frac{\Delta Q/Q}{\Delta P/P}=\frac{\partial Q}{\partial P}\cdot\frac{P}{Q}\] which is a percentage change in quantity demanded divided by a percentage change in price.</description>

<p>Hello, this is Roh <code>$\rho$</code> !</p>
<p>Hello, my name is Hyunwoo Roh and you can call me Roh. After finishing the grad school in US and working as consultant/researcher in IT finance company, now I stay in a city called Daegu (Korea) doing civil service for two years. My research interests focus on statistical and machine learning analysis on data related to finance industry.</p>
<p>While studying in University of Chicago (UoC), I was a <a href="/teaching">teaching assistant</a> and grader for several courses in statistics, econometrics, and finance courses at bachelor and master&rsquo;s level. I did screenshot my part of course evaluation done by the UoC students. See my CV to have a more detailed overview of my academic and professional background.</p>
<p>Given my experience, I also help academics and professionals in performing statistical data analyses for their academic or work related projects. Feel free to contact me if you need help for your statistical analyses.</p>
<p>I am another boring consultant &amp; data scientist who interested in applying Stat/ML models in financial data.</p>
